+++    Quick Start       +++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
On first time use, let the config.ini be created. The installer will place
the third party apps like mcmapDZ & eihort in your folder:
C:\Users\<USERAME>\Documents\MCMyVault
You will then be prompted for the locations; Remember to choose 32bit or
64bit depending upon your system. If you don't know what type of system you
have, in general if you receive errors when trying to run them, try the 
other.

If no config.ini is created, MCMyVault will create a default generic 
config.ini.

+++    Backup Files      +++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The backup file must have the following format:
<WORLDNAME>_<anythingelse>.zip

WHEN RESTORING, if a .minecraft\saved folder exists with the first part of the backup name
the folder will be deleted, and be replaced with the backup content.

New in version 1.7.0.0+, after an extraction of a backup zip, it will make sure the 
folders are in the correct location in the .minecraft\saved\<mapname>\ folder.
