Texture previewing...
\pack.txt = name of texturepack
\pack.png = the World screenshot preview image
\gui\background.png = background
\gui\gui.png = has the menu buttons
\gui\crash_logo.png = has the Minecraft logo
\gui\items.png = has a overview of all the items.



Add a tab for texturepack management; logic as follows:
X) Has two selections: Current texturepacks and backup texturepacks
X) Cannot have the same backup location as worlds
3) Reads the current texturepacks in the texturepack folder.
4) When texturepack selected, show a preview similar to Minecraft
5) Right-click on one of the current texturepacks to backup
6) Right-click on one of the backuped texturepacks to restore
7) Must see if it is a zip file, if so then read zip
