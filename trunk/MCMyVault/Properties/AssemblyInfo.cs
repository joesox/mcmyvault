[assembly: AssemblyDescription("More than a Minecraft (MC) Backup Manager, it also works with other MC utilites to act as a mapper and world viewer. Manager your Minecraft worlds from this single app. The backup is stored in a zip file saving some disk space and better portability.This is an Open Source Project 'As Is' program. I wish I had time to squash every bug and add every new great feature but I run out of time. Feel free to work on the code yourself. However, from my more popular projects in the past, requests and bugs come flowing in and are important to people. I must get the motivation to dive back in the code, so I do charge a service fee for this.")]
