More than a Minecraft (MC) Backup Manager, it also works with other MC utilites (thanks to mcmap2 and eihort (bundled in Windows setup file) to act as a mapper and world viewer. Manage your Minecraft worlds from this single app. The backup is stored in a zip file saving some disk space and better portability

## Support and Donations ##
This is an Open Source Project 'As Is' program (You can join the project if you want, just contact me). I wish I had time to squash every bug and add every new great feature but I run out of time. Feel free to work on the code yourself. However, from my more popular projects in the past, requests and bugs come flowing in and are important to people. I must get the motivation to dive back in the code, so I do charge a service fee for this. Just visit the website below if you are interested.

These two get bundled with the MCMyVault Windows setup file. As far as I know, this is not breaking any of their licenses but please let me know if that is not the case.
